This mod was made by the request of someone who wanted to stick up the biggest middle finger possible to biology. Well now we can all send birds at biology, because while age will decrease fertility, the lowest it will ever be is 5%. 

Sure it doesn't make sense, but to be fair, how many pawns have died from age related issues in a late game colony? Exactly, only one. And Jimmy deserved it. Jimmy shouldn't have pissed of the doc.

Unrelated to the mod, take a look at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879306896]Show Fertility on Health Tab[/url]. It's a great mod for both general gameplay and verifying if your fertility minimum mod works.

Looking for more options on fertility? Check out my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974206359]Fertility Genes[/url] mod. It adds a lot of extra options beyond the normal 3.
